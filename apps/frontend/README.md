## Getting Started

This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

> **Note:** This project also works with npm, yarn, or bun, but pnpm is recommended for consistency.
